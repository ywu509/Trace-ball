# Trace-ball
GUI trace File Viewer is a simple object-oriented model. The design includes the class structure with Swing components (a menu, radio buttons, a combo box and a JPanel) and AWT graphics (a diagram visualising data), Using a JFileChooser, handling various events associated with Swing components, and data input from a text file. 

This is an unfinished version and will be updated very soon.
